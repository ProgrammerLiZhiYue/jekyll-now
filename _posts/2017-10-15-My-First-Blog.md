title: My first post
---

This is my first formal post. However, actally this is not the first time I write a blog. I used [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and then switched to [Hexo](https://hexo.io), but now I back to use [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).

My writing style is freestyle, haha. I'll modify posted blog when I notice a error, maybe grammar error or logic error, but I'll use highlight color to ditinguish differnces. I decide to using this blog for recording my learning. If I have time, when i learning Java, Python or C#, I got some thoughts, I'll write in this blog.

For now, I use default them fork from [Jekyll-Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com), but I'll change it this year later depend on whether I have sufficient time.
